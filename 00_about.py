# 🛠️ **About EvidenceBot**
**EvidenceBot** is a cutting-edge, privacy-preserving tool designed to empower users with advanced interactions using Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline, this app ensures efficient and secure processing of large document sets while maintaining data privacy.

---

## ✨ **Key Features**
1. **Privacy-Preserving RAG Pipeline**:
   - Breaks documents into manageable chunks and retrieves only the most relevant context for queries.
   - Ensures sensitive data remains secure within a local environment.
2. **Customizable Parameters**:
   - Experiment with RAG-related parameters like chunk size and embedding models.
   - Adjust LLM parameters (e.g., temperature) to fine-tune outputs for specific tasks.
3. **Response Modes**:
   - **Chat Mode**: Engage with the tool as a chatbot.
   - **Batch Mode**: Submit multiple queries simultaneously and store results in a structured format.
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation Module**:
   - Compare LLM-generated responses against ground truth using metrics such as BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and BERTScore.
   - Supports graphical insights and batch processing for large-scale evaluations.
